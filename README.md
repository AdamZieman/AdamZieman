<h1>Hi, I'm Adam!</h1>


<!-- Brief Introduction -->
I'm enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, UNIX System Administration certificate, and Cyber Security certificate. Additionally, Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer. It is my goal to one day work as a software engineer!

<h3><a href="https://github.com/AdamZieman/Java_2DSearchTree">2D Search Tree</a></h3>

TwoDTree is a data structure used for storing 2D points that allows for efficient range search queries. The tree is built by recursively partitioning the plane into smaller rectangles, and each node compares points by x or y value depending on the level of the tree. Searches for points within a given range are done by recursively traversing the tree and only exploring subtrees that might contain points in the range. <br><br>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/AdamZieman/Java_HeapMedian">Find Median of Heap</a></h3>

Uses two heaps to maintain the median of a stream of integers in constant time. The max heap stores the smaller half of the data and the min heap stores the larger half. The program inserts the next element into the appropriate heap based on its value, and rebalances the heaps as necessary to maintain the constraints. The getMedian method returns the median of all the data inserted. If the number of elements is even, it returns the average of the max from the max heap and the min from the min heap. If the number of elements is odd, it returns the max from the max heap. <br><br>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/AdamZieman/Java_FindMedianUnsortedArray">Find Median of Unsorted Array <i>(optimized)</i></a></h3>

Optimizes the search of the median element of an unsorted array. The driver class, generates random integer arrays of increasing sizes and finding their median and the time taken to search the array. <br><br>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/AdamZieman/Java_GenericReverseOrderSorter">Generic Sorter</a></h3>

Iterates over a list and returns the list in descending order. The driver class reads input from a file containing strings, integers, doubles, then prints the list in descending order. <br><br>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/AdamZieman/Java_Synonyms">Synonyms</a></h3>

Returns the synonym of a given word by analyzing the frequency of occurrences of each word in a corpus of text files using cosine similarity between frequency vectors. It stores the descriptor vectors for each word in a HashMap and calculates the cosine similarity between two words using their respective frequency maps. <br><br>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/AdamZieman/Go_CLI_ToDo">CLI To-Do List Manager</a></h3>

From the command line, a user can manage a todo list by adding a task, deleteing a task, or clearing all tasks. The task list is stored in the program as a slice, and on the system in the file "tasks.txt". User input is read using bufio and manipulates the task list using a switch statement. The Task type is a struct with an ID and name. The program outputs the current task list and available commands to the user. <br><br>
